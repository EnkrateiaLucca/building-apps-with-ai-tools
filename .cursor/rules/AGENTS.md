# Rules for html apps

- The theme of the apps will always be green
- At the top of any app you should write: "App executed by Lucas in collaboration with Cursor's Agents"

# Progress Tracking

- After each session where you create or edit a file, make sure to create
- or update a `progress_status.md` file with a single line explaining what was done and writing the names of the files involved.
